## Add maven shade plugin

The Maven Shade Plugin is used to create an uber-JAR or fat JAR, which is a single JAR file that contains all the project's dependencies, along with the project's own code. This is useful when you want to distribute a Java application with all its dependencies included in a single executable file, making deployment and execution easier in environments where external dependencies are not available.
